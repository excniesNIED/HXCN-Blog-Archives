# The Refund Battle with Academia.edu: A True Account of Fighting for an $89 Annual Fee

The story began on September 6, 2025. At the time, I was participating in the CUMCM (Contemporary Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling). To find reference materials, I paid $1 through the Academia.edu platform to download two crucial papers. Little did I realize that this seemingly routine transaction would sow the seeds for a storm brewing just one month later.

Fast forward to October 23rd. A PayPal notification email struck like a bolt from the blue. It revealed my account had been charged $89 by Academia.edu. This deduction occurred the day after I received my university research grant, leaving sufficient funds in my bank account for the withdrawal. My heart skipped a beat. Since September 6th, I hadn't received any email reminders about the renewal.

A similar experience occurred not long ago. I was once charged $10 by Scribd because I forgot to cancel the auto-renewal. However, that refund process was incredibly smooth. By following the instructions from the AI chatbot in the bottom-right corner of the platform, the refund was processed quickly.

However, Academia.edu's process was a maze. The official website had no clear self-service refund option, only a tutorial on "Cancel my Academia Premium subscription Auto-Renewal". Following the guide, I had to complete a long questionnaire and reject several "50% off" and "Keep my memberships" before I could finally disable the automatic payment authorization in PayPal. This was merely stopping the bleeding, not getting back the $89 that had already been taken.

Helpless, I started searching online for others' experiences and found a Reddit thread where many people had been quietly charged hundreds or even thousands of dollars by Academia.edu.

Following the advice in the thread, I sent my first appeal email to the official support address, "support@academia.edu," with a polite tone, hoping for a peaceful resolution.

>Subject: Refund Request - Annual Subscription Charge (PayPal: exc\*\*\*\*\*com)
>
>Dear Academia.edu Support Team,
>
>I am writing to request a refund for a recent charge of $89.00 made to my PayPal account (exc\*\*\*\*\*com) for an annual premium subscription.
>
>I have not used the Academia.edu premium services in the past month, and I was not aware that my subscription was set to auto-renew. This charge of $89.00 was unexpected.
>
>Given that I have not been using the premium features, I kindly request a full refund of this $89.00 charge.
>
>I have already gone into my PayPal account and canceled the automatic payment agreement to prevent any future charges.
>
>Thank you for your understanding and prompt assistance with this matter.
>
>Sincerely,

Days passed, and my email went unanswered. I realized that an email might not be enough to get their attention. So, I found the ticket submission system on their official website and formally submitted my appeal as a ticket. After some searching, I found the submission portal here:

https://support.academia.edu/hc/en-us/requests/new

At the same time I submitted the ticket, I also sent an identical email to the support address.

The next day, a reply arrived. I had naively thought it would be the clearing of a misunderstanding, or at least an equal conversation. However, the words on the screen made my blood boil:

> Subject: Refund Request - Annual Subscription Charge (PayPal: exc\*\*\*\*\*com)
>
> Dear Academia.edu Support Team,
>
> I am writing to request a refund for a recent charge of $89.00 made to my PayPal account (exc\*\*\*\*\*com) for an annual premium subscription.

>
> Thank you for your understanding and prompt assistance with this matter.
>
> Sincerely,

> Churnie HXCN

The next day, a reply arrived. I naively hoped it would resolve the misunderstanding or at least initiate an equal dialogue. Yet the words displayed on the screen left me utterly furious:

> Subject: Your Academia Premium Payment
>
> Hello Churnie,
>
> Thanks for getting in touch with us regarding this payment. Our records indicate that this payment is for an Academia Premium subscription renewal.
>
> While we're unable to process refunds for subscription renewals, we want you to know that your support genuinely makes a difference in advancing research worldwide. Your subscription helps us connect researchers globally, improve our recommendation systems, strengthen our infrastructure, and develop new tools, like better ways to find and apply for grants, that benefit the entire academic community.
>
> I have cancelled the auto-renew on any subscription associated with this email address, so you will not be billed again on this subscription. However, if you have a subscription with another email address, you may need to contact us from that email address to get that payment cancelled. You can also reply to this email address and we will look into your issue in more detail.
>
> We’re so happy that you have been a part of Academia Premium, and we hope to see you back at a later date.
>
> If you have any questions, please reply to this email. Your request is Ticket ID # 9\*\*092.

It was a cold, impersonal template email. In a frosty tone, it informed the main account holder that “subscription renewals are non-refundable.” Then, shifting gears, it resorted to moral blackmail, claiming the $89 was for “supporting global academic research.”

This rhetoric was the epitome of hypocrisy. I paid for the two papers I downloaded. As for this $89 charge, I was neither aware of it nor had I used the service, so how could it be called "support"? Disguising non-transparent charges as a contribution to academia is not only despicable but also a great insult to students and researchers.

I felt immense irony and rage. After reading another blog post titled "Academia Refund Warning," I decided to take a much harder stance. I had to make my position crystal clear: this was not a routine "renewal," but an uninformed and unauthorized charge. I planned to submit another ticket, explicitly stating that their actions violated my consumer right to be informed and threatening to take all necessary follow-up actions if the issue was not resolved.

My second appeal email adopted a much stronger tone. I detailed the transaction's background and formally invoked their 30-day refund guarantee policy. I explicitly informed them that if the refund was denied, I would immediately initiate an "unauthorized transaction" chargeback through PayPal and file formal complaints with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).

> Subject: URGENT Follow-up: Refund Request for Unauthorized Charge (Ticket ID # 9\*\*092)
>
> Dear Academia.edu Support Team,
>
> I am writing to formally dispute the denial of my refund request concerning the $89.00 charge processed on October 23, 2025 (Ticket ID # 9\*\*092). Your previous response stating that refunds are not processed for "subscription renewals" is unacceptable. This situation is not a standard renewal; it is a case of deceptive billing and a failure to secure informed consent.
>
> My interaction with your platform was extremely limited. On September 6, 2025, I paid a fee of \$1.00. This payment was intended solely to access two specific documents required for my participation in the CUMCM (National College Student Mathematical Modeling competition). This transaction was understood to be a one-time access fee. At no point was I made clearly aware that this action enrolled me in an $89.00 annual subscription.
>
> Following this single interaction, I did not use the Academia.edu platform again. I received no email notifications, reminders, or invoices between September 6 and October 23. There was no communication indicating that a trial period was ending or that a significant charge of $89.00 was imminent. This lack of transparency is a failure to meet basic consumer protection standards. Had I been properly notified, I would have canceled the service immediately.
>
> The \$89.00 charge on October 23 was unauthorized. It was drawn from my PayPal account (exc\*\*\*\*\*com) without my explicit knowledge or recent consent. This sum represents my school subsidy, and its unexpected removal has caused significant financial distress. Your justification that this payment "helps connect researchers" is an inappropriate deflection. I have already paid for the documents I accessed. This $89.00 charge is for a premium service I never knowingly requested, never used, and never intended to purchase.
>
> Furthermore, my initial request cited your 30-day money-back guarantee. The charge was posted on October 23. My request for a refund was submitted well within this 30-day window. Your refusal to honor this policy for a charge I was not even aware of is unjustifiable.
>
> I have already canceled the automatic payment authorization within my PayPal account to prevent future charges.
>
> Please consider this my final attempt to resolve this matter amicably. I request an immediate and full refund of the $89.00 charge.
>
> If this refund is not processed promptly, I will be forced to escalate this issue. I will proceed with filing a formal chargeback with PayPal, classifying this as an "Unauthorized Transaction." I will also submit official complaints to the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). These complaints will detail Academia.edu's deceptive billing practices and predatory auto-renewal policies.
>
> I expect a confirmation of my full refund.
>
> Sincerely,
>
> Churnie HXCN

Disappointingly, this detailed appeal was met with yet another identical template email. They even assigned me a new ticket number, treating me as a brand-new complainant with no trace of prior communication. This mechanical, perfunctory approach shattered any remaining hope I had for constructive dialogue through their customer service system.

Faced with such dismissive responses, I realized I must adopt the strongest possible stance. Combining advice from friends and online experiences, I prepared a final ultimatum. This time, I would not only reiterate previous legal and platform threats but also add leverage they couldn't ignore: public scrutiny. I threatened that my friend, who has over 2.3 million followers on YouTube and TikTok, would publicly expose my entire ordeal—including screenshots of all email correspondence—if my legitimate rights weren't protected. This would reveal their unscrupulous business practices to more students and researchers. Simultaneously, I sent a copy via the email linked to my PayPal account, proving the refund request originated from me.

>
>Dear Academia.edu Support Team,
>
>This is my final communication to amicably resolve the issue of the unauthorized $89.00 charge to my PayPal account (exc\*\*\*\*\*com) on October 23, 2025. Your repeated, identical responses under ticket IDs #922092, #922677, and #922679, which state that refunds are not processed for "subscription renewals," are entirely unacceptable and fail to address the specific, serious nature of my complaint.
>
>My interaction with your platform was a single, isolated incident on September 6, 2025. I paid a \$1.00 fee to access two specific documents for my participation in the National College Student Mathematical Modeling competition (CUMCM). This was understood to be a one-time, pay-per-view style transaction. At no point was I clearly and transparently informed that this action would enroll me in a recurring annual subscription of $89.00.
>
>Crucially, your company failed to provide any form of communication between September 6 and October 23. I received no email notifications, no reminders of a trial period ending, and no invoices warning of an imminent significant charge. This complete lack of notification is a severe breach of consumer rights and transparent billing practices. Had I been properly informed, I would have taken immediate action to prevent this charge. A "renewal" implies prior consent, which was never established for this $89.00 amount. The charge was therefore not authorized.
>
>Your company's justification that this payment supports researchers globally is an inappropriate deflection from what are clearly unethical billing practices. It is profoundly ironic to claim to support research while imposing financial hardship on an undergraduate student. The $89.00 charged to my account constituted my school subsidy, and its unexpected seizure has caused me considerable financial distress. I am a student aspiring to a career in research, and this experience has been disillusioning. While your terms of service may be constructed to permit such actions, they are in direct conflict with ethical business conduct and consumer protection standards.
>
>I must also point out your refusal to honor your own 30-day money-back guarantee. The charge was processed on October 23, and my initial refund request was submitted well within this period. Your dismissal of this policy in my case is unjustifiable.
>
>Consider this your final opportunity to rectify this situation internally. I demand an immediate and full refund of the $89.00 charge.
>
>If this refund is not confirmed within the next 24 hours, I will proceed with the following actions without further notice:
>
>First, I will file a formal chargeback with PayPal. The dispute will be classified as an "Unauthorized Transaction." The primary evidence for this dispute will be your failure to provide any advance notification, invoice, or warning for this charge, proving I did not authorize it.
>
>Second, I will submit official complaints to the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). These complaints will detail Academia.edu's predatory auto-renewal policies and deceptive billing practices.
>
>Third, I will publicly document this entire experience. I will share my correspondence with your team on my personal website and social media platforms to warn other students and researchers. I will also engage an associate, who maintains a combined audience of 2.3 million followers on YouTube and TikTok, to ensure this warning about your company's unethical practices reaches the widest possible audience.

Within three hours of sending this email, the main account received a response. This was by far the most efficient interaction. The other party abandoned their previous arrogance and indifference, promptly agreeing to my refund request and stating the funds would be credited within 5 to 10 business days. The efficiency of this communication was night and day compared to previous exchanges.

>Subject: [Academia] Re: Final Demand for Immediate Refund: Unauthorized Charge on PayPal (exc\*\*\*\*\*com) - Ticket IDs #9\*\*092, #9\*\*677, #9\*\*679

>Hi Churnie HXCN,
>
>Thank you for continued followed-up on this issue. After discussing this with our team, we've decided to grant you a one-time exception to our refund policy. However, moving forward we will not be able to offer refunds on renewal payments after your 30-day low cost trial and we will not be able to process any additional refunds for you on this subscription or any additional subscriptions.

>Depending on your bank, you will see the refund show up anywhere between 5-10 business days from now.
>
>With your free account, you'll retain access to all our Academia free features, such as uploading and downloading single papers, messaging, basic analytics, title search, and your profile.

>Please let us know if we can help you out with anything else, and thanks for being a part of the Academia community!

Finally, the substantial sum of $89 was returned to the main account holder, bringing this weeks-long tug-of-war to a close.

This experience taught me a profound lesson: when faced with unreasonable business practices, cold corporate rules, and automated customer service systems, consumers' silence and compromise are precisely the "tacit consent" they most desire. Every concession you make becomes a pre-checked "agree" box in their backend system.

May my story serve as a warning, a beacon. When you find yourself in a similar predicament, remember: do not fear making your voice heard. Master the rules and elevate your complaint from a feeble plea to a forceful ultimatum. Only by transforming yourself from a lamb led to slaughter into an adversary who understands the rules, holds the cards, and is prepared to fight, can you reclaim the respect and rights that rightfully belong to you.

Finally, and most crucially: **Manage payment methods linked to auto-renewals with extreme caution.** Especially for foreign currency payments or credit cards tied to auto-renewals, **avoid keeping large sums in your account long-term** to prevent catastrophic losses from “accidental” charges. Some traps spring the moment you click “Agree.”
